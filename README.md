## OCR-Endpoint

A spring restful endpoint created for the use of The DreamTeam. This endpoint is the connector holding the system together, it provides resources for our Mobile App to communicate to the Ocr-core server via this endpoint as well as for our Raspberry Pi. The website also draws its data from this endpoint allowing for us to only need to map the database once. 

## Purpose of this project

The DreamTeam is a Monash University undergrad team building a software solution for Aztomix (our "employers") under the guidance of our Monash University mentor. This counts as credits spanning accross 2 semesters and is called the Industrial Experience Project (FIT3047 - FIT3048). 

## The System - Access Control System (ACS)

The system is a combination of Automatic NumberPlate Recognition (ANPR) and security. The whole system provides a certain company, specifically our employers (Aztomix) to see the comings and goings of vehicles on their premise (known and unknown), thus the name Access Control System (ACS) was born.

## Other software packages in the system

Ocr-core (OCR server for numberplate extraction)
Acs-Raspberry (Automatic system for capturing vehicle numberplates)
Acs-ControlPanel (Website for controlling certain areas of the system)
Acs-App (Android Mobile app for taking manual pictures of a vehicles numberplate)
